    "Dictionaries are meant to be called by their keys. The order of a dictionary's keys is **not-predictable** (even though the above example seems to stay in the order we put time in... this is not dependable because its using a hash to map keys to items). You can access all values in a dictionary using the values command.\n",

    "write a module (in a .py file) that does takes a list of 2 numbers and sorts them from low to high using a if...elif...else statement. Also include a function that will take a longer list of numbers (say 5) can uses a 'for' loop to compute the product of all numbers in the array. Bonus - for the first function that sorts the two numbers, do some checking to make sure that the input is exactly two numerical values and return with a helpful message if not. "
